# VPN-PortForwarding
This is a bash script to allow you to open your ports for an open NAT type in game assuming you are running a linux box in-front of your gaming machine.
It also drops many known UDP DDoS vector packets. This is useful for low bitrate attacks that do not entirely overwhealm your network connection, it saves a lot of processing on the machine that these packets would otherwise be destin to with an open nat type.
